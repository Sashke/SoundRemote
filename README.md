OS X application for using SoundCloud without browser

![SoundRemote](/Screenshot.png)

This is my first expirience in developing applications for OS X. 

Most of the time in my browser opened more than 40 tabs and finding tab with Sound Ð¡loud becomes a challenge. So I decided to develop this app for quick access to search and switch tracks.

If you have troubles with playing some tracks then install the newest Adobe Flash Player version from adobe.com. WebView can't use inner WebKit flash player so it need external flash plugin.

## TO-DO:
- Global hotkeys
- Show track title and image in status bar menu
- Hide app from dock
- Warning when Adobe Flash not installed

Feel free to send pull requests.
